# Overview

This is a basic platformer game built through python's arcade library. Ther is only bare bones functionality right now so the controls are restricted to the keyboard. Use WSAD or the arrow keys to move. W or the Up arrow control jumping.
I've always been interested in game design so this was my first real attempt at making a game. There are some fun mechanics I wanted to try and inforportate for level traversal but those will come at a later date.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to program the game. It utilizes the Arcade library in python for the gameplay elements. I also used a tilemap program called Tiled for the stage building. Tiled allows for pick and place level building instead of
being restricted to assigning locations through python by pixel.

# Future Work

* Resolve stagebuilding bugs that cause crashes when interacting with merged elements.
* Add in enemy entities with set movement patters
* Incorporate movement mechanics like dash or double jump to expand traversal options
